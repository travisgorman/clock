#[Clock with JavaScript & CSS](http://travis.bingo/clock/)
An "analog" clock with hour, minute and second hands that tick like a busted old watch. 

# Useful/Interesting Things I Learned Making This App:
* CSS rotation transformations
* modifying the axis point with `transform-origin`
* `transition-timing-function` 
* the **bezier editor** in Chrome dev tools
* Date object methods
  - `getSeconds()`
  - `getMinutes()`
  - `getHours()`
* styling transformations with JavaScript expressions
