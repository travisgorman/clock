#[Clock with JavaScript & CSS](http://travis.bingo/clock/)
An "analog" clock with hour, minute and second hands that tick like a busted old watch. 

# Useful/Interesting Things I Learned Making This App:
* [CSS transformations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform) specifically `rotate` & `translate`
* modifying the axis point with [`transform-origin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-origin)
* `transition-timing-function` 
* the **bezier editor** in Chrome dev tools
* Date object methods
  - `getSeconds()`
  - `getMinutes()`
  - `getHours()`
  [there are a bunch of others](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)
* styling transformations with JavaScript expressions
* [Transition Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TransitionEvent{

And I didn't use transformation functions here, but they look interesting, so [here's a rabbit hole](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function)
